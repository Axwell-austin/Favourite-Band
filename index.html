        <p>Twenty One Pilots is an American musical <em>duo</em> from Columbus, Ohio. The band was formed in 2009 by lead vocalist Tyler Joseph along with Nick Thomas and Chris Salih, both of whom left in 2011. Since their departure, the line-up has consisted of Joseph and drummer Josh Dun. The duo is best known for the singles <strong>"Stressed out"</strong>, <strong>"Ride"</strong>, and <strong>"Heathens"</strong>. The group received a Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards for "Stressed Out". The band independently released two albums, <strong>Twenty one pilots</strong> and <strong>Regional at Best</strong>, before being signed by record label Fueled by Ramen in 2012. Their label debut, Vessel, was released in 2013 and became the second album in history on which every track received at least a gold certification, making Twenty One Pilots the first band in the history of music to see every song on two albums earn gold or platinum awards.

            The duo achieved breakthrough success with their fourth album, <strong>Blurryface, 2015</strong>, which produced the successful singles "Stressed Out" and "Ride" and became the first album in history on which every track received at least a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. The release of the single "Heathens" also made the group the first alternative artist in history to have two concurrent top five singles in the Billboard Hot 100 and the third rock act in history to have two singles simultaneously chart in the top five of the Billboard Hot 100.</p>

             <h3>Why Twenty One Pilots</h3>
             <p>The twenty one pilots are undeniably good, right from their video edits, their poetic lyrics and the 5 star drummer Josh Dun whs drumming is a total banger. There are many bands, but I will choose twenty One Pilots all day every day because of how Joseph Tyler is always adamant about one major thing; the message of his tracks. The video tracks of the band are very detailed, creative and soothing by the way they rhyme with the song itself. one thing for sure, if you are not an Alternative Rock fan, try listening to them, there will be no going back for sure! Here is the link to my favourite album by Twenty one Pilots.</p>
